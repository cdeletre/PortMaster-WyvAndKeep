Please read [Online Server moved to a DIY basis](https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/263960/view/3383912359082967591). If you own the steam version as well you might be able to run on Windows a local server and configure it in `wyvandkeep/savedata/setting.cfg` with the `server` parameter. It has not been tested, I'm just sharing the information I have found.
